so, a few issues. The main one is that you aren't using queues correctly in either the .cpp or the .py files. the idea behind the assignment was that with your queues you would append every '(', but not the ')'s. aka a loaded queue should look like '(((((((((((((((', not '()()((()))()()()'. the idea is when you encounter a ')', you pop a '(', so the queue would go from '(((' -> '(('. ping me if you'd like more information.\
anyway. your stacks look great. 7/10
